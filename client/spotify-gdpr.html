      <h2 class="header">How it works</h2>
      <p>
        The GDPR is a European law that requires tech companies to let you download the data that
        they have collected about you. It turns out that Spotify has a record of every time that you
        stream any song, and that information can be turned into colourful graphs and charts!
      </p>
      <p>
        This service will take your GDPR data and give you a detailed look at your own listening
        history and how your listening patterns have changed over time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="header">Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike with our <a href="/spotify-analysis.html">music analysis</a> service, we do not store
        any information about you when you submit your GDPR data. All of the analysis is performed
        in your browser, and the only requests sent to the server are to match song names to
        artists, genres, and albums.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to log into Spotify with your account because we can't get that information
        from them unless you log in. The login prompt will say that we are requesting access to your
        subscription details. We <a
        href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/#user-read-private">need
        this permission</a> in order to search for songs.
