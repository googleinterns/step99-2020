                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                           This is my portion of the 2020 Google STEP Capstone project.
                           With this feature, you can enter in a Youtube video name or ID
                           and get a solid estimate on how the video was received via
                           comment analysis. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           In order to achieve this, I took advantage of the 
                            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">Google Natural Language (NLP)</a> 
                            and <a href="https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/home">Google Perspective</a> APIs 
                            to analyze comments returned to me from the
                            <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">Youtube Data API</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Method</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to ensure the most accurate analysis while handling the minimum amount
                            of data, this tool takes the 20 most relevant comments from the Youtube API,
                            weights each comment based off of the number of likes it receives, then creates
                            an overall score proportional to the number of likes.
                            Here is what each API is responsible for:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            NLP
                            <p class="indent">    
                                NLP returns a magnitude and score value which give us the Overall Response. 
                                The score value contributes to the corresponding adjective:
                                Positive, Negative, or Mixed. If a video is "Clearly" one
                                of these values, NLP returned a high magnitude rating and thus is confident 
                                that the given data supports its score. Click

                            <p class="indent">   
                                Perspective returns a series of probabilities which correspond to attributes such
                                as Toxicity, Insult, Identity Attack, etc. These probabilities indicate how likely
                                the text is to have these effects on the readers. It is important to note that all
                                attributes except for Toxicity are in the experimental phase right now. Click

                        <h3>Programming techniques</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've implemented techniques like caching, pattern-matching, 
                            search, and string manipulation to provide the best possible experience
                            and just to have some fun with this. 
                            The code is all open source and can be found 
                            <a href="https://github.com/googleinterns/step99-2020">
                            here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Limitations</h3>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, there are some limitations on how the tool can work 
                            since this technically is a Google product and I am under 
                            the jurisdiction of the company. Here are the biggest ones:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The API quota only allows for 94 search calls a day, 
                                    assuming no visitors use the Youtube API on one of my podmates' pages.
                                    Please use a video ID if you can!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I can only fetch and parse through so many comments with the small quota. 
                                    The video matching and comment parsing algorithms I have are decent, but
                                    they are constrained.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
